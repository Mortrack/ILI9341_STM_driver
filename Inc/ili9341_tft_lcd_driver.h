 * @defgroup ili9341 ILI9341 240RGBx320 resolution and 262k color 3.2" TFT LCD Driver module
 * @{
 *
 * @brief   This module provides the functions, definitions, structures and variables that together work as the driver
 *          for the ILI9341 240RGBx320 resolution and 262k color 3.2" TFT LCD with the purpose of being used by the
 * 			application.
 *
 * @note    Another thing to highlight is that this @ref ili9341 has included the "stm32f1xx_hal.h" header file
 *          to be able to use the SPI in this module. However, this header file is specifically meant for the STM32F1
 *          series devices. If yours is from a different type, then you will have to substitute the right one here for
 *          your particular STMicroelectronics device. However, if you cant figure out what the name of that header file
 *          is, then simply substitute that line of code from this @ref ili9341 by: #include "main.h"
 *
 * @details <b><u>Code Example for using the @ref ili9341:</u></b>
 *
 * @code
  #include <stdio.h>	// Library from which "printf" is located at.
  #include <stdint.h>   // This library contains the aliases: uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, etc.
  #include "ili9341_tft_lcd_driver.h" // This custom Mortrack's library contains the functions, definitions and variables that together operate as the driver for the ILI9341 Device.

 *
 * @note    This Global Static Pointers and variables that will be updated, initialized and/or persisted in the
 *          @ref ili9341 by this function are the following:<br>
 *          - The @ref p_hspi Global Static Pointer to point to the address towards which the \p hspi param points to.
 *          - The @ref p_ili9341_peripherals Pointer to point to the address, which should contain the required data of the GPIO peripherals towards which the 3.2" TFT LCD Device is connected to with respect to our MCU/MPU.
 * @note    <b>This function must be called only once</b> before calling any other function of the @ref ili9341 .
 *
 * @details Subsequently, this function will configure the ILI3.2" TFT LCD Device by following the next steps in that
 *          orderly fashion:
 *          1. Apply an ILI9341 Hardware Reset.
 *          2. Apply an ILI9341 Software Reset.
 *          3. Set the ILI9341 Power Control 1 to have its GVDD Level to 4.6V.
 *          4. Set the ILI9341 VCOM Control 1 to have its VCOMH and VCOML voltages set to 4.25V and -1.5V respectively.
 *          5. Set the ILI9341 VCOM Control 2 so t hat the VMH and VML have an offset of -58 and -58 respectively.
 *          6. Configure the Memory Access Control.
 *          7. Configure the Pixel Format to 16 bit per pixel (i.e., 65k color mode).
 *          8.
