# ILI9341 240RGBx320 resolution and 262k color 3.2" TFT LCD C STMicroelectronics driver library

Version: 0.0.0.0

**IMPORTANT-NOTE:** This library is still under development. Wait for official release, which will be made under version
1.0.0.0

This library provides the definitions, variables and functions necessary so that its implementer can use and communicate
with a ILI9341 240RGBx320 resolution and 262k color 3.2" TFT LCD Device from a microcontroller/microprocessor of the
STMicroelectronics device family and, in particular, via the STM32CubeIDE app. Know that this Driver Library is very
complete for professional projects where you require to use this sensor and that all the available functions and
features of this Driver Library has been successfully validated. For more details about this and to learn how to use this
library, feel free to read the <a href=#>documentation of this project</a>.

# How to explore the project files.
The following will describe the general purpose of the folders that are located in the current directory address:

- **/'Inc'**:
    - This folder contains the <a href=#>header code file for this library</a>.
- **/'Src'**:
    - This folder contains the <a href=#>source code file for this library</a>.
- **/documentation**:
    - This folder provides the documentation to learn all the details of this library and to know how to use it.

## Future additions planned for this library

This Driver Library is already very complete and professional, but if required and if there are any suggestion you would
like to give, I am completely open to integrate your ideas into this project. Let's make the most awesome, complete and
professional ILI9341 Driver Library together.
